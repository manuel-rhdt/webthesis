# Quantifying the Flow of Information

This repository contains a web version of my PhD thesis, converted from the original LaTeX source using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). The web format is easier to read, especially on mobile devices.

## About

How do living cells information? Which parts of signals carry information? This thesis develops **Path Weight Sampling (PWS)**, a novel Monte Carlo technique that—for the first time—makes it possible to compute the mutual information between input and output trajectories *exactly* for any stochastic system.

The key idea is to use the master equation or the Onsager-Machlup functional to evaluate the exact conditional probability of an individual output trajectory for a given input trajectory, and to average this via Monte Carlo sampling in trajectory space. By establishing connections between information theory and statistical physics (such as path probabilities and partition functions), we leverage techniques from soft condensed-matter physics to make this computation efficient.

In the thesis, we also demonstrate the practical utility PWS by applying it to bacterial chemotaxis, one of the best-characterized signaling systems in biology.
