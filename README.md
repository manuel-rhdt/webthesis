# PhD thesis website

This repository contains the HTML code converted and adapted from the original LaTeX source of my PhD Thesis "Quantifying the Flow of Information".

You can see the rendered result here: [Quantifying the Flow of Information](https://manuel-rhdt.github.io/webthesis/)

Currently it is still a bit rough around the edges
- cross references are ugly
- cross references across different chapters do not work
- no equation or figure numbering
- some artifacts from conversion

However the content is the same as the print thesis and is much easier to read, especially on mobile.
