<p>This thesis could not have been written without the support of many
people. More than just scientific support I received lots of emotional
support which is essential yet underrated. To express my gratitude for
this support I want to acknowledge the wonderful people who made this
possible.</p>
<p>First, <strong>Pieter Rein</strong>, thank you for sticking with me,
having my back, fighting for me, and helping me through thick and thin.
You always were able to reignite my enthusiasm, even when my own
motivation would waver. You provide a great atmosphere for research, you
are always available for discussions, you care about the people at least
as much as about the project, and you are willing to consider different
perspectives and evolve your views. Your commitment to fair, open, and
rigorous science is one of your strongest qualities. During our many
meetings I learned a lot from you, not just about research but more
generally about life.</p>
<p>Thank you also to my co-supervisor <strong>Gašper</strong>. Your
advice can only be described as magical. Many times, when Pieter Rein
and I found ourselves stuck on a certain problem, an email to you would
result in an eager reply filled with extremely useful suggestions and
creative ideas that set us back on track. I also deeply appreciated your
hospitality when you hosted me in Vienna for a few weeks; I felt warmly
welcomed by your group and left truly inspired.</p>
<p><strong>Mareike</strong>, you were the first person I met when I
stepped into AMOLF on my first day as a master’s student. I immediately
sensed a connection with you. My senses did not betray me; from that
moment on we started developing a friendship that has become one of my
most treasured. You have been of tremendous importance to me, and I am
not exaggerating when I say that without you, this thesis would not
exist. It all started even before I moved to Amsterdam. As a master’s
student contemplating an internship position at the biochemical networks
group at AMOLF, I looked for the most recently hired PhD student in this
group—you—and emailed to ask about the work environment. The response I
received was not only overwhelmingly positive but also incredibly kind,
convincing me to come to Amsterdam. About a year later, when I was
offered a PhD position at AMOLF, you were the first person I wanted to
share the news with. I vividly remember our joy about me being able to
stay for 4 more years. Throughout the ensuing PhD time, your example and
enthusiasm provided strong guidance and support. But you have been far
more than a wonderful mentor at AMOLF. Many of our cherished stories
unfolded outside of work, including countless trips, crazy parties and
beautiful evenings sharing a bottle of wine. Many of the people that I
thank below I know through you. I am happy to look back and see that we
built a little community here in Amsterdam that has shaped our lives. I
feel so grateful for having met you.</p>
<p>I want to thank my paranymphs, <strong>Christian</strong> and
<strong>Katharina</strong>, who have been a never-ending source of
inspiration, support, and fun over the course of my PhD.
<strong>Chris</strong>, I am deeply grateful for the privilege of
closely sharing the journey of life with you over the past few years.
Our friendship means so much to me. You genuinely care about the people
close to you, and your presence is a gift. Maybe you don’t know this but
I admire your eloquence. You have a remarkable ability to find words for
expressing your sensations and feelings genuinely and precisely. With
this comes a deep sense of security that you embody and radiate. With
you by my side I feel empowered to push boundaries and step out of my
comfort zone, yet always feeling safe. I look back on so many joyful,
exciting, and daring adventures we shared and undoubtedly will keep
sharing. It is rare to find someone like you whom I can fully trust one
hundred percent. Moreover, your enthusiasm is contagious and when you
deeply care about something it is truly inspiring and moving. We have
transformed together, learned so much through each other, and I am
certain that our mutual growth will continue. <strong>Kathi</strong>,
you are a beacon of joy in my life. Over the years, we must have
accumulated hundreds of hours of talking to each other about anything
and everything. I remember countless times of coming to your office or
to the tweezer lab for a “quick question” or a bit of gossip, only to
find ourselves, two hours later, still completely lost in conversation.
With you, any ordinary activity transforms into an exciting mission,
whether it’s shopping for lamps, finding the best Airbnb, shooting a
movie scene, exploring activities at Christmas lunch, or discovering the
best party locations at pride. We complement each other so well as a
team and I am looking forward to our future missions. You care deeply
about the people around you, always willing to help with a lot of
empathy. Because you’re naturally drawn to reflect deeply on situations
and people, your advice is incredibly valuable and thoughtful. I know
that whenever I struggle, I can count on you. Moreover, I admire your
devotion and energy for pursuing the things you care about, whether it
is a scientific publication, sleeping for a night in the mad king’s
castle, fairly managing interpersonal conflict, or obtaining K-pop
tickets for a sold-out show. Thank you for all the time we spend
together—whether dancing, supporting each other, deeply reflecting about
philosophy, working on a project, or simply being in each other’s
presence.</p>
<p>Next, I want to thank my partynymphs, <strong>Lucie</strong> and
<strong>Imme</strong>, for bringing so much light and enlightenment into
my life. <strong>Imme</strong>, we met during a global pandemic, yet we
managed to build a close friendship within weeks. And then you had the
wonderfully bold idea of doing a house swap: me living in Utrecht and
you living in Amsterdam for a week. It was a success and your house
since has always felt like a second home to me, a special and beautiful
connection. I am happy to say that bold ideas and outside-of-the-box
thinking are rather the rule than the exception with you. You are so
inspiring! You introduced me to the wonderful sport of ice skating,
which I started enjoying so much that we decided to sign up for courses
together religiously every winter. You also made me listen to your
favorite Dutch artists which led to me enjoying the music so much that
we ended up going to music festivals together for it. I am curious what
will come next! We have navigated ups and downs together, forging a bond
so strong that I am convinced we will remain connected, no matter what
the future holds. <strong>Lucie</strong>, with our overlapping social
circles, it was only a matter of time before we became friends
ourselves. Yet, when our friendship finally formed, it surpassed all my
expectations. We have incredibly deep chats about a plethora of topics,
and I am very grateful for all the amazing advice you offer. Not only
that, but we can also laugh endlessly over the same »joke« for months.
You are so much fun to be around! And your heart is in the right place,
too. Your passion for fighting patriarchy and tackling the climate
catastrophe is powerful and contagious. The energy and thought you bring
into your relationships—with your partner, family, friends, and
yourself—deeply inspire me. Thank you for sharing your enthusiasm and
opinions, your joy and wisdom.</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong>, meeting you led to the single most impactful
shift in my Amsterdam life. Without knowing each other all too well, we
decided not only to move in together, but also to plan a holiday to
Belice. Although we ended up going to Mexico instead, I am glad that we
took the courage for both decisions as they marked the start of our
adventures together. You are a wonderfully kind and loving flatmate, as
well as a brave and enthusiastic travel companion; what a unique
combination! Beyond Mexico, we have explored many beautiful locations
together, including Noordwijk, Vienna, Nice, Munich, and Colombia. I
hope this is only the beginning of a list that will keep growing. Not
only that, but we also manage to make life in Amsterdam an adventure. We
have seen countless movies together, shopped in the most exclusive
boutiques, we have been partners in crime (literally). Our shared
excitement for niche French concerts brings me joy. I also want to
especially thank you for supporting me in the final and sometimes
challenging stretches of the PhD. You made that time so much easier for
me. With few people can I feel such uninhibited joy as with you and I
want to thank you for that.</p>
<p>I want to thank my present and past colleagues from the biochemical
networks group for making daily work so enjoyable. To
<strong>Harmen</strong>, who left the group not long after I started,
thank you for welcoming me into the group and helping me get started.
<strong>Alex</strong>, I remember many fun lunches with you and Mareike
during the pandemic which would represent the highlight of my day. You
have a great sense of humor as well as very deep knowledge about many
topics but what stands out most about you is your sense of true
curiosity. Not only are you curious in a scientific sense about the
mysteries of the world, but even more so curious and enthusiastic about
the people that surround you. Thank you for our deep conversations, for
your advice and wisdom. <strong>Age</strong>, we started our PhD on the
same day, and our defenses are only six days apart. It has been such a
joy to embark on this journey alongside you. I admire your capacity for
structured thought, your analytical math skills and your pragmatic,
down-to-earth attitude. It makes working with you a real inspiration and
joy. I feel we are such a good team together, which is proven by how
quickly we were able to finish our project together. I enjoyed all the
conferences that we went to together. I also appreciate your sailing
skills that saved us from the sand bank. <strong>Jenny</strong>, thank
you for radiating joy and excitement as well as always being willing to
engage in thoughtful debate about topics that you care about.
<strong>Mike</strong>, I greatly appreciated your passion for helping
everyone in the group with our projects. Your vast knowledge and
willingness to share it truly made a difference.
<strong>Muriël</strong>, it was a pleasure to supervise you and witness
you gradually taking ownership and responsibility for your project.
<strong>Maxim</strong>, your good spirits and intelligent questions were
consistently inspiring and your project became a big success.
<strong>Ramon</strong>, I’ve had some of the most interesting
conversations with you; thank you for sharing your knowledge. I applaud
your principled attitude towards science and societal topics in general;
you represent integrity and honesty in a way few people do. I thank you
for your involvement in the works council for improving working
conditions for everyone. <strong>Avishek</strong>, I am happy that after
getting acquainted with each others’ humor, we can finally laugh so much
together. I deeply appreciate all the work and thought you put into
extending PWS and all the incredibly illuminating discussions we had as
a result. <strong>Julien</strong>, though I often only saw you on screen
during group meetings, your visits to Amsterdam were always a lot of
fun. I especially fondly remember cooking a delicious meal with you on
the sailing boat during our group outing. <strong>Vahe</strong>, I
appreciate your unique perspective on science and your genuine
fascination for nature and physics. <strong>Daan</strong>, I am
delighted by your unconventional way of thinking, which adds so much
value to the group! Thank you for bringing Dutch poetry to the group
lunch. I wish you a lot of success in finishing your PhD.
<strong>Claudio</strong>, you radiate positive energy. In the relatively
short time you have been at AMOLF, we have connected on so many layers
beyond science. <strong>Menno</strong>, you just started your PhD and
even though we overlapped very briefly, I enjoyed exchanging ideas with
you. <strong>Geert</strong> and <strong>Robin</strong>, it was a joy to
see you taking on your master’s projects with enthusiasm and finishing
them successfully.</p>
<p><strong>Bela</strong>, thank you for showing up for the daily coffee
break, every morning at 10:30, without fail. Fortunately, even during
the pandemic you insisted on keeping the coffee break alive via virtual
sessions, which I am very grateful for. I don’t know how I would have
been able to endure the social isolation without these regular meetings.
Both the virtual and the real coffee breaks were essential for creating
a feeling of connection and belonging within the group. Your retirement
from AMOLF had a big impact on me and the group, and coffee breaks would
not be the same anymore but I am happy that you are still regularly
coming to AMOLF even after your retirement.</p>
<p>A special thanks goes to our experimental collaborators at AMOLF.
<strong>Fotis</strong>, your expertise of <em>E. coli</em> chemotaxis is
spectacular and talking to you about the biological intricacies was very
fascinating and useful. <strong>Evan</strong>, I admire your
determination and attention to detail in doing complex single-cell
<em>E. coli</em> experiments. Moreover, your way of presenting science
is magnetic. Thank you for putting your heart into this project!
<strong>Tom</strong>, thank you for seemingly never stopping to think
deeply about any research question as well as for all the advice you
have offered me. Your scientific questions and comments show a very deep
understanding of and passion for science. Your interest in my projects
was always a huge motivator.</p>
<p>I also enjoyed fruitful collaborations and interactions beyond AMOLF.
A special thanks goes to my collaborators at MPI-CBG in Dresden.
<strong>Anne</strong>, you took the initiative in forming a
collaboration between our labs and I am so grateful for that. It was
amazing to see how you managed to build the mathematical tools to answer
a question that seemed so difficult to address. I enjoyed working with
you and talking with you. With you, it’s a double-edged sword. One one
hand, I am excited to have found someone that works in the same niche as
me. On the other hand, you also humble me as you clearly understand
information transmission on deeper level than me.
<strong>Christoph</strong>, thank you for many insightful conversations
and your honest feedback on ideas and drafts.</p>
<p>A special thanks also goes to the members of the Tkačik lab at ISTA
who welcomed me so enthusiastically during my time in Vienna.
<strong>Camila</strong>, <strong>Tereza</strong>,
<strong>Natalia</strong>, <strong>Bahti</strong>,
<strong>Julian</strong>, <strong>Athina</strong>,
<strong>Simon</strong>, <strong>Réka</strong>, <strong>Michal</strong>,
<strong>David</strong>, it was great meeting all of you. I particularly
enjoyed our stimulating conversations about science and many other
topics in the cafeteria as well as various fun trips into the city of
Vienna.</p>
<p>Beyond those I directly worked with, I want to thank many other
people at AMOLF whom I am very grateful to have gotten to know during my
PhD. <strong>Moritz</strong> thank you for your kindness, loyalty, and
for being a fantastic companion in our bouldering sessions and as we
learned to climb outdoors together. <strong>Anne-Sophie</strong>, it is
always so much fun (and perhaps slightly unproductive) when we are in
the office together. Thank you for all the hilarious, deep, senseless,
and funny conversation. Moreover, I want to thank you for all the absurd
adventures we have had together outside of work. Every memory we make is
a great one and we are unquestionably gifted at picking out amazing
locations to eat or to party. I look forward to our future adventures!
<strong>Kim</strong>, thanks for sharing your incredibly positive
energy. The year you were at AMOLF was so much fun.
<strong>Francesca</strong> it is always fun to go bouldering together
and I enjoyed the parties together. Thank you for bringing me into your
friend group. <strong>Timo</strong>, thank you for sharing your passion
for cooking and preparing some chef-quality meals and desserts. You are
incredibly generous. <strong>Lori</strong>, it was fun to chat and play
board games with you. I enjoyed being your neighbor.</p>
<p>I want to thank the PV, the staff association which brings so much
energy and fun to AMOLF through its events. Thanks to
<strong>Jente</strong>, <strong>Yvonne</strong>,
<strong>Evelijn</strong>, <strong>Igor</strong>,
<strong>Sofija</strong>, <strong>Mels</strong>, <strong>Mees</strong>,
<strong>Teressa</strong> and all the other PV members, past and present.
I deeply appreciate your efforts to bring joy to the AMOLF community,
and I cherish the years I spent in the PV myself. Especially the
Christmas party was always such a blast!</p>
<p>A very big thank you to the support departments of AMOLF. In
particular, I want to thank for the great support from the ICT
department in setting up and maintaining the computational cluster which
was indispensable for me. Thanks, <strong>Gerben</strong>,
<strong>Michiel</strong>, <strong>Sean</strong>,
<strong>Kallinikos</strong>, <strong>Cees</strong>, and
<strong>Pieter</strong> for solving all the problems regarding the
cluster. I appreciate all the work that goes into maintaining it
working. Thanks also <strong>Erny</strong> and <strong>Petra</strong>
for helping with communicating my research to a wider audience and for
organizing the Science Day. Thanks to <strong>Clyde</strong> for caring
about workplace ergonomics, to <strong>Hinco</strong> for being able to
fix anything, anytime and being cheerful meanwhile. I appreciate the HR
department, especially <strong>Wouter</strong> and
<strong>Linda</strong>, for helping me find housing and answer all
contract-related questions.</p>
<p>I also want to thank the wonderful people I met outside of AMOLF and
that shaped my life. <strong>Nina</strong>, thanks for the joy of
dancing together, for chatting endlessly, and for sharing our passion
for music. <strong>Maxime</strong>, thank you for bringing so much fun,
for patiently teaching countless board games, and for the wonderful time
you spent in Amsterdam; it was truly a joy having you here.
<strong>Victor</strong>, every time I see you you cheer me up with your
humor and positive attitude. Thank you for taking me to the best Mexican
concert in Amsterdam. <strong>Lucas</strong>, your friendly calmness is
addictive. You’ve got a great sense of humor and I admire your
dedication to finishing what you started, whether it is a bike race or a
very hot chili pepper. <strong>Mirko</strong>, you are wonderfully
down-to-earth and have a perfect subtle wit that always makes me laugh.
<strong>Tamara</strong>, you are a person full of life and love. Thank
you so much for sharing your amazing joy with the people around you.</p>
