<h1 id="about-the-author">About the Author</h1>
<p>Manuel Reinhardt was born on May 16, 1996, in Ebersberg, Germany. He
grew up with both German and Spanish roots. His early fascination with
science and problem-solving led him to participate in the International
Physics Olympiad, where he reached the third national round in Germany
during the 2013/14 competition.</p>
<p>Driven by a desire to understand the fundamental rules that govern
the world, Manuel pursued a Bachelor of Science in physics at the
Ludwig-Maximilians-University in Munich from 2014 to 2018. For his
bachelor’s thesis, he focused on computational quantum physics,
reflecting his growing interest in numerical simulations. Seeking to
broaden his horizons, he spent a semester studying abroad at Universidad
Autónoma de Madrid as part of the Erasmus+ program.</p>
<p>After his experience abroad, Manuel continued his studies at LMU
Munich, graduating with a Master of Science in 2020. Inspired by his
previous experience abroad, he decided to complete his master’s thesis
in Amsterdam, working under the supervision of Pieter Rein ten Wolde.
Part of his work during this period are presented in this thesis.</p>
<p>In 2020, Manuel embarked on his PhD at AMOLF Amsterdam, continuing in
the Biochemical Networks group under Pieter Rein ten Wolde’s
supervision. His research explores the fundamental principles of
biological information flow, using theoretical and computational
approaches to understand how cells process information. The results of
this research are presented in this thesis.</p>
